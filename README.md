# color-grading
### A basic python image-process program
In fact, This is just one of my homework of  digital image process class,which is quite rough and simple.
with the help of OpenCV
The main functions of this program are as follows:
1.exchanging lighting,saturation,color temp and contrast of the image we choose in the file.
2.using trackbar to modify all of these relevant parameters dynamically.
